Introduction
============
This addon allows to store files directly into a filesstore in  the data
directory, and serve those to the user without encoding or decoding.

Configuration
=============
If it doesn't exist, the module creates a parameter `ir_attachment.location`
with value `file`. This will make new attachments end up in your
data path (the odoo configuration value `data_dir`) in a subdirectory called
`filestore`.
